# airflow_plugins
A collection of few plugins that we use in our Airflow workflows. 

## Getting Started

1. Place the plugin folder inside `AIRFLOW_HOME`.
1. Make sure you have all packages that are being used in plugins already installed in your environment.
1. Restart Airflow Webserver. 

Contributions are welcome and are greatly appreciated!   
Every little bit helps :). We will be improving this repo with more hacks soon.
